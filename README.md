# ClockIn
Background Application I created to alert myself when I have been afk usually for lunch and need to clock in again. I get the coordinates of the mouse and after a few minutes test the location of the mouse again. If after 30 minutes the location of the mouse has not moved it is safe to say that I am afk so it alerts me when I come back to the computer.
